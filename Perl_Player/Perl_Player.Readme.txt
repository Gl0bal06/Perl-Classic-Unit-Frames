Player Frame
	by Perl
		v. 0.41  7.3.5

---   Description   ---
This addon creates a replacement for the default Player Frame.  It should have all the functionality of the original, and then some.

---   Usage   ---
The addon can be dragged by moving the name portion of the frame.
There are the following commands:
	lock - Lock the frame in place.
	unlock - Unlock the frame so it can be moved.
	buffs - Toggle the built in buff monitor on the player frame.
	alerts - Toggle warning messages for buffs (at 30 seconds left).
	hideart - Hide most of the art on the bottom bar (cosmetic).


---   Installation   ---
Simply unzip and place the resulting folder in your Interface\AddOns\ diretory 
inside the main World of Warcraft directory.
