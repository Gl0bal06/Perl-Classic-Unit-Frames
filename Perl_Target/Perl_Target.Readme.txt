Target Replacement
     by Perl
          v. 0.5  22.2.5


Description
     This addon is designed to replace the default targetting frame with a movable, 
more interesting one.

- Target's name, colored to match the friendly and pvp status of the target.
- Target's level, colored based on the target's level in relation to the player,
  with a "+" to denote elites.
- For player characters, a class icon will appear by the name to display the 
  player's class.  The icons used are from the character creation screen.
- Status bars, of both health and mana, show as numbers if known, otherwise percents.
- Dragable to wherever you want it.
- Smooth healthbar color with Perl_Common.
- Replacement bar textures with Perl_Common.
- PVP Icon.
- Mana bar colored to skill type or hidden if a mob with none.

Usage
    There are three commands to be aware of:  '/perltarget lock' and '/perltarget 
unlock' lock and unlock the frame so it cannot be dragged; '/perltarget combopoints'
toggles the display of combo points.  The window may be dragged by dragging the name 
area.
